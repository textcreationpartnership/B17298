            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>A Remedy that Cures all Fevers in general, it never failing once in a Hundred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, and of all that have fallen under my Care, I do declare, I never had one but what Recovered, which I am sure no Practitioner in Physick, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>London,</hi> can say the like. It cures the most Malignant or Spotted Fever, in a short Time; they seldom keep Bed above four <hi>Days,</hi> intermitting Fevers or Agues, tho' of several Years continuance, <hi>viz.</hi> Quotidians, Tertians and Quartans, which Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy cures tho' (the Quartan or Fourth Day Ague is) called the Scandal of the Physician.</p>
            <p>For the Wind Colick in Bowels or Stomach, a Cordial Water which far exceeds all Medicines for pleasantness and prositableness; but if it is a Billious Colick, which you will know by this not curing, then I have Pills will effect the Cure.</p>
            <p>Papers of Powder for the Worms of all sorts, which brings away the Slime that breeds them, with the Bags they are sometimes inclos'd in. I shall give you a few Symptoms, by which you may know whether Old or Young are troubled with Worms, tho' the latter are seldom free. <hi>viz, Squeamishness, Vomitings,</hi> a <hi>Sower Breath, Tenesmus;</hi> a <hi>Swelling of the Belly,</hi> and sometimes a <hi>Dog Appetite, Dry Coughs, Shiverings, Fevers,</hi> these are a few Symptoms amongst a great many.</p>
            <p>Papers of Powders for the <hi>Green Sickness,</hi> or <hi>White Fever,</hi> (and all Obstructions) which if not taken care of in Time, very often ends in a <hi>Consumption.</hi> The <hi>Green Sickness</hi> or Obstructions, are sometimes occasioned by Worms, as I have Experimentally found, therefore not to be cured but by them that can cure the former effectually.</p>
            <p>The Head Ach frequently cured in six minutes, Swimmings, Diffiness in the Head, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 span">
